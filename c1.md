Computer is trained, instead of programmed.

Machine learning discovers rules for executing a data processing take.

Machine learning models are all about finding appropriate representations for their input data - transformations fo the data that make it more amenable to the task at hand.


Learning, in the context of machine learning, describes an automatic search process for data transformations that produce useful representations of some data, guided by some feedback signals - representations that are amenable to simpler rules solving the task at hand.


Deep learning, deep isn't a reference to any kind of deeper understanding achieved by the approach, it stands for this idea of successive layers of representations. depth = number of layers.

Neural network refers to neurobiology, but deep learning models are NOT models of the brain.

Deep learning is a mathematical framework for learning representations from data.

Information distillation process, information goes through successive filters and comes out increasingly purified - useful with regard to some task.

Naive Bayes - assuming all features are totally independent.

Deep learning stands out because 1. performance 2. automates feature engineering (SVM manual work).

How deep learning learns from data 1. incremental, layer-by-layer in which increasingly complex representations are developed 2. intermediate incremental representations are learned jointly.

Gradient boosted trees for shallow-learning problems, deep learning for perceptual problems.
